# train-your-prompts
"Train Your Prompts" is a powerful tool designed to help users refine and compare different prompts for AI systems or data-driven applications. The app allows users to dynamically add panels, input API endpoints, and compare results side-by-side. With features like file imports and interactive comparisons, it provides a seamless environment to experiment, test, and optimize prompts for maximum efficiency. Whether you're exploring AI tools or evaluating APIs, this app makes the process intuitive and efficient. To begin, simply select one of the option pills at the top of the interface to assign an API to a comparison panel. When the option pill is selected, a dialog appears where you can input the API Name (to label it in the UI) and the API Endpoint URL. An example of an API endpoint might look like this: https://api.example.com/generate-response. Additionally, you can provide optional parameters like an API key for authentication or query parameters for specific behaviors. Once you click the “Add” button, the API becomes associated with the respective panel, and you’re ready to compare its output. or instance, let’s say you’re comparing three APIs: OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Azure AI, and Google’s Bard. You can input their respective endpoints and send a sample text like, “Explain the concept of machine learning.” Each panel will display the corresponding API’s response, allowing you to evaluate differences in content quality, tone, or accuracy. This side-by-side comparison empowers you to identify the API that best meets your requirements. If you’re unsure how to find API endpoints, most APIs have comprehensive documentation available on their provider’s website.
